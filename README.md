# JADER Rule-Based Agent

The library extends the standard JADE agent platform (https://jade.tilab.com/) by introducing rule-based agent behaviours.
It combines:
1. **Rule-Based Expert System** (where initial RETE algorithm and Rule-Based Engine were taken from [Easy Rules](https://github.com/j-easy/easy-rules) library)
2. **Expression Languages** ([MVEL2](https://github.com/mvel/mvel))
Within the library, the developer can find a set of methods and tools that are needed in order to implement RES agents.
